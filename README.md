# PyBer-Analysis
Finished Jupyter Notebook Deliverable: [PyBer Challenge](/PyBer_Challenge.ipynb)
  
## Overview
Using Pandas and Matplotlib in Jupyter Notebook, I completed a ride-sharing analysis by city type.  The summary will help leadership at PyBer make future decisions concerning driver count and fare amount in urban, suburban, and rural cities.
    
## Resources
Here are the csv files containing the datasets:     
[City Data](/Resources/city_data.csv)   
[Ride Data](/Resources/ride_data.csv)

## Results
Quick note on procedure and description of differences in ride-sharing data between city types.  
Remember: total rides, drivers, fares; average fare per ride and driver; and total fare by city type
